### As a [famous general once said](https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc)... *Hello there!*

I'm [Thomas Can](https://toma.dev/), a self-taught developer from France, Normandy. 

What I do : 
- I specialize in Front End development and Web design : as a CSS enthousiast, I like to create beautiful and simples things.
- I always enjoy clean code : I use [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) and [Sass 7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) for my projects.
- I'm only interest in quality : I want my creations to be responsives, fast and accessibles to everyone.

What am I doing right now ? 
- :computer: I’m currently working on my first WordPress Theme
- :books: I’m currently learning PHP & WordPress

In the future, I'd like to...
- ... learn JS fundamentals :metal:
- ... to get [Opquast quality certificate](https://www.opquast.com/a-propos/)
- ... to collaborate on Open Source projects.

And about me...
- I'm currently looking for a job ! :fist:
